        Changes for compatibility with Text::WikiFormat 0.7 - we now have
        nested lists!

0.05    17 July 2003

        **** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ****

        URL munging is *not* now performed by default.  You need to pass
        a "munge_urls" parameter to ->new in order for this to happen.

        **** RELATED NOTE FOR PEOPLE WITH OPENGUIDES INSTALLS ****

        Do *not* install this version of CGI::Wiki::Formatter::UseMod
        unless you are using OpenGuides version 0.21 or later.

        ->node_name_to_node_param method now takes notice of the
        force_ucfirst_nodes attribute.

0.03    28 April 2003
        Subs in macros are now called with up to nine arguments.  I know this
        is a bit arbitrary, but I now need it to support two arguments and I
        might as well allow a few more while I'm at it.

0.02    5 April 2003
        Macros can now substitute the output of subs as well as plain strings.

0.01    3 March 2003
        Initial release.
